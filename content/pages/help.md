This is a brief guide on how to manage site content using the netlify [content mangement system](/admin). If you don't have access to this, please contact Andrew W.

Most content is a _homepage section_ or a _page_. All homepage sections are displayed on the home page. Giving these a picture is optional, but it'd be good if most sections could have a picture on them. Homepage sections can have fancy buttons added to them, most of which will probably link to a page.

Pages are stand alone, and no one will see them unless something links to them.

Pages and homepage section buttons have lists of "special functionality" that can be turned on. For the most part, this should be ignored. This is used for things that can't otherwise be done directly through the admin section, such as linking to the latest magazine file, or showing the contact form. We could add new functionality fairly easily, but Andrew W would have to do that.

Below is a list of all pages on the site. The "address" field shows what to put as the target of a link or button to allow people to visit that page. No one will see pages that aren't linked to from the home page.
