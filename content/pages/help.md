This is a brief guide on how to manage site content using the netlify [content mangement system](/admin). If you don't have access to this, please contact Andrew W.

Most content is a _homepage section_ or a _page_. All homepage sections are displayed on the home page. Giving these a picture is optional, but it'd be good if most sections could have a picture on them. Homepage sections can have fancy buttons added to them, most of which will probably link to a page.

Pages are stand alone, and no one will see them unless something links to them.

Below is a list of all pages on the site. The "address" field shows what to put as the target of a link or button to allow people to visit that page. No one will see pages that aren't linked to from the home page.
