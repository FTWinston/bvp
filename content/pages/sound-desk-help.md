This is a brief guide on how to run the audio-visual system during a typical service. Suggestions welcome!

## In advance

The hymns and any powerpoint presentations etc should be prepared in an Easy Worship presentation file.

## Setting up

1. Turn on the various TV screens at their respective wall sockets.\
   (The TVs should turn on automatically - if any don't, the remote controls are at the sound desk.)
2. Power up the sound system by turning on all the sockets under the desk.
3. Turn on the laptop, enter "1954" as the PIN.
4. Connect the USB cable and HDMI cable on the right-hand side of the laptop.
5. Connect up its power cable and plug that into a socket beneath the desk.
6. Turn on the mouse.
7. On the laptop, launch *Audacity* and click record. Minimise this window.\
   (Do this as early as you like, we can trim the recording as needed.)
8. Launch EasyWorship and reopen the saved presentation file for the current service.\
   The TV screens should turn black. If they continue to show the desktop, close EasyWorship and open it again.\
   If they show nothing at all, check the cable connections.
9. Double click on the first item in the running order (the left side) to show that on the screens.
10. Assuming we haven't sorted the problem with entering scripture readings in advance, on the *scriptures* tab at the bottom of EasyWorship, type in the reference for the desired scripture reading, in a format like *John 1:1-14*, and drag the selected verses into the running order.
11. If relevant, confirm the expected number of verses for each hymn with the organist.\
    (We often split verses across more than one slide, which can make this confusing.)\
    If verses should be deleted, do this by expanding the item in the running order and deleting them from there.\
    (If they are deleted in the "current hymn view" on the right, they will return next time the hymn is opened!)

## During the service

1. Click the *Logo* button on the top right of the screen (or press *control + L*) to toggle between showing the current item and a "holding" slide on the TV screens. You can still move between different items in the running order while this logo is showing.
2. Show a particular item in the running order (the left side) by double clicking on it. Its individual slides will show on the "current item" view (the right side), and you can show a specific slide by clicking on it.\
   (Note that the *next* item is highlighted in the running order, not the current one. This can be confusing.)\
   You can also move between items in the running order using the *Page Up* and *Page Down* keys, and move between slides in the current item by using the *left* & *right* arrow keys.
3. Make sure that the *font* microphone on the sound desk is not muted. This is one of the middle sliders. The mute light is *on* when muted, and off when unmuted.\
   Leave this microphone unmuted throughout the service, so that the sound of the organ is recorded.
4. Optionally, mute the minister (the leftmost slider on the sound desk, marked *Tie Mic 1*) when they're not talking. Definitely mute them if hymns are being sung.
5. Adjust the volume slider for the minister's microphone and/or the font microphone if needed. Anyone talking should be loud enough to hear easily.

## End of the service

1. Close EasyWorship. You don't need to save any changes here.
2. Once the organ finishes playing, open the minimised *Audacity* window and click stop. From the file menu, chose *export* and then *export as MP3.* Enter a file name in the BVP Worship folder of dropbox (or failing that, on the desktop) and save. Don't bother to fill in any of the optional data fields.
3. Wait for the export to finish, then close Audacity, telling it that you don't want to save changes.
4. Turn off the laptop, unplug the cables connected to it, and turn off all the sockets underneath the sound desk.
5. Turn off the sockets for the TVs.

## Troubleshooting

### If the minister cannot be heard

Is there a "signal" light on the wireless microphone receiver sitting above the sound desk on the left?\
If so, sound should be reaching the desk. Is the channel (the leftmost, *tie mic 1*) muted on the sound desk? The *mute light should be off.*

If the signal light is not on, ask the minister to check that their mic is turned on, and if a power light shows on it. If it is on and the light doesn't show, it may need a new battery. It takes a single AA battery, which are kept in a shelf under the sound desk.

If they still cannot be heard, ask them to use the *font* microphone. (Ensure that it is not muted.)
