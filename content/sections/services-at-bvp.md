We meet for socially-distanced morning worship services on Sundays at 11am. These are led by our locum, Derek Peat, with music by our organist, Douglas Gibson. While many things have to be done differently at this time, all are welcome to attend. Additionally, recordings of our services are available on this website - see below.
