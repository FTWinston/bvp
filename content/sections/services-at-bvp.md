We will resume meeting for socially-distanced morning worship services on Sundays at 11am. Services are conducted in a covid-compliant manner by our locum, Rev Derek Peat. Additionally, recordings of our services are available on this website - see below.

In this difficult time, you might want to visit the [Try Praying](https://www.trypraying.co.uk/) website. This is a resource for those *"who are not religious and donâ€™t do church,"* and might be of benefit to yourself, or someone you know.
