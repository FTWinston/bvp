## _All meetings are currently suspended due to the covid-19 lockdown. We will meet again, as soon as it is safe to do so._

We meet for morning worship on Sundays at 11am. During our morning services, we have the J-Team for primary school children, and a Bible Class for secondary school children. Creche facilities are available for babies and toddlers.

We also have an evening service at 6.30pm on the 1st, 3rd and 5th Sundays of the month during school terms.
