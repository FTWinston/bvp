Balshagaray Victoria Park was a Church of Scotland located in the west end of Glasgow.

We have recently merged with Partick South church to form [Partick Victoria Park Church](https://partickvictoriaparkchurch.org.uk/).

The Balshagray building is not being used for regular services. Visit our new church's website for more information.
