Due to current COVID restrictions, we have temporarily stopped meeting in person on Sunday mornings.

We are currently in the process of uploading an online service for Sunday 3rd January, but have run into a last minute snag and this is taking longer than expected.

In the meantime, the Moderator of the Church of Scotland has produced an online service for viewing today. You can watch this by clicking the button below, and our own service should be available early this afternoon.
