As we aren't currently meeting in person, we have begun producing online services. [These can be viewed here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzOIyHFSwtPjI6jrDuHefcQ), and the latest service is also available below. The online services are presented by our locum minister, Derek Peat, with music by our organist, Douglas Gibson.

When we meet in person, recordings of our church services are available to listen to online. You can also listen to the latest recording or online service by phoning **0141 465 4333**.
